# Client Side JavaScript
We explored the origin of JavaScript and its grassroots on the client side. Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich of Netscape, JavaScript is most used development language for developing web applications.
Although it has some syntax similarities to Java language, JavaScript operates substantially different as it allows development of dynamic pages.
In order to increase its acceptance and popularity in the industry, Netscape was able to get it accepted as a ECMA standard in 1997.

This code demonstrates how DOM can be manipulated with JavaScript and how to handle events and prevent default processing of events by the browser.
